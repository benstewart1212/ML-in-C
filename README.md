# ML-in-C
This is a recreational coding project (Meaning I am following a guide) to learn ML in C. 

There are several goals with this project:
1. Start an interesting project to get back into programming after a short hiatus
2. Get an intro to C programming
3. Get an intro to Machine Learning

Question: If we want something from data can we create a model to predict an outcome?

Single Neuron: resembles an artificial single neuron as is the basis for most ml models. Extremely simple example but acts as a stepping stone. Still pretty cool imo ;)
